# Intrusion Detection System

Detecting network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms.
Monitor a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider.
The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‚Äòbad connections‚Äô (intrusion/attacks) and a ‚Äògood (normal) connections‚Äô.

## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
The data used here comes up with no 100% guarantee. So, don't use it for making decisions. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use MACHINE LEARNING in tackling Cyber Security Threats and can save our systems from being corrupted.

## Introduction
Cyber Security is very important these days as everyone has systems and everyone is using internet and its services to do their work. In this kind of situations it is very important that we learn about some measures to tackle these threats.
